# Ethereum Solidity Koans
Taking a deeper dive on the Solidity language.  Using truffle for a simple platform to manage a test suite as I explore Solidity. 

# Not actually Koans 
I loved the Ruby Koans however, I now just use that word on Repo's I'm using to dive deeper into a language 

#Work in progress
I'll be in/out of this Repo over the comming months as I explore various aspects of the language.
